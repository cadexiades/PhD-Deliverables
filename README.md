# PhD Deliverables

This repostory contains the open-source deliverables produced as part of Christos Dexiades's PhD project titled 'A Creative Data Ontology for the Moving Image Industry'.

The aim of this project to explore whether there is a practical use case for using ontologies to manage metadata in the moving image industry and to determine whether an ontology can be designed for such a purpose and can be used to manage metadata more efficiently to improve workflows. As a result, a domain ontology has been created, hereby referred to as the Creative Data Ontology, engineered around a set of metadata fields provided by three post-production companies and four use cases. The Creative Data Ontology has been evaluated using both quantitative methods and qualitative methods (via interviews) with domain and ontology experts.

## Directory Structure

The `PhD-Deliverables` repository has the following high-level structure:

```
PhD-Deliverables
│
├── creative-data-ontology
│
└── intro-to-ontologies
```

* The `creative-data-ontology` directory contains the final version of the Creative Data Ontology prior to the completion of the project.

* The `intro-to-ontologies` directory contains a video which was created to introduce non-technical domain experts to ontologies before participating in interviews to evaluate the Creative Data Ontology.

## Funding

This project was funded by [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/) as part of its contribution to the [StoryFutures](https://www.storyfutures.com/) Creative Industries Clusters Programme ([AH/S002758/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS002758%2F1)).
